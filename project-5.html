			<p class="project-description">Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most realtime chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. For server, I have hosted node.js socket code in heroku. For client side, I have integrated in Android as well as in iOS. So, the user can chat through Desktop as well as from mobile.
